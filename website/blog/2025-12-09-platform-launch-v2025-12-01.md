# NovaEco v2025.12.01 — The Platform is Live 🚀

Today marks a major milestone: **NovaEco has transitioned from a concept to a deployed, functional platform.**

With the release of **v2025.12.01**, we have finalized the ecosystem architecture, deployed the core infrastructure, and codified the 48 critical use cases that will drive the circular economy. This isn't just a website update—it is the launch of the **Federated System-of-Systems**.

## 🏗️ The "Skeleton" is Complete

We have successfully implemented the **Federated Monorepo** architecture defined in our governance standards. The ecosystem is no longer a monolith but a network of specialized, interoperable repositories:

* **Core Kernel (`novaeco`):** The heart of the system is live.
    * **Identity (`/auth`):** Centralized SSO issuing secure Trust Profiles.
    * **Gateway (`/api`):** A unified API acting as the "front door" for all sectors.
    * **Mission Control (`/app`):** The dashboard where users manage their circular assets.
* **Linked Libraries:** We've released internal SDKs (like `ecosystem-core-auth-client`) that allow sectors like **NovaAgro** to validate permissions via high-performance gRPC without re-implementing auth logic.
* **Standardization:** Every repository now adheres to strict "Golden Templates" for structure, ensuring that a developer moving from `NovaFin` to `NovaWater` feels right at home.

## 📊 48 Scenarios for a Circular World

We have finalized the **Use Case Matrix**, moving from abstract ideas to concrete, testable flows. The platform now supports 4 distinct levels of complexity:

1.  **Level 1 (Onboarding):** Foundations like *[O1] The Citizen Passport* and *[O12] Biogas Cert Upload* establish trust and identity.
2.  **Level 2 (Transactional):** Frictionless actions like *[E1] The Waste Match* and *[E7] Solar Log* drive immediate value.
3.  **Level 3 (Coordination):** Value chain optimizations like *[M5] Fair Wage Audit* and *[M6] V2G Balancing* connect disparate stakeholders.
4.  **Level 4 (Systemic):** Transformation engines like *[C1] Fiber-to-Fiber* recycling and *[C7] Algorithmic Governance* close the loop entirely.

## ⚙️ The "Factory" is Running

A platform is only as good as its tooling. We have deployed a sophisticated **CI/CD & QA Pipeline** that automates the lifecycle of every line of code:

* **Automated Release Engineering:** Our `publish-*.yml` workflows now automatically build, test, and package artifacts (e.g., `novaagro-api.tar.gz`) whenever code is merged.
* **The QA Signal:** Releasing a component now triggers a `repository_dispatch` event to our **Ecosystem QA** hub. This "Gatekeeper" spins up a dynamic test environment to verify that the new artifact works with the rest of the system before marking it as "Stable".
* **Release Manifests:** We now track the exact "Bill of Materials" for the entire platform in the `novaeco-releases` repository, ensuring operational stability.

## 🤝 Ready for Contributors

With the skeleton built and the guidelines (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`) in place, NovaEco is ready for the community.

Whether you want to build a **Worker** to calculate carbon footprints or a **Product** to visualize urban mining stocks, the infrastructure is waiting for you.
