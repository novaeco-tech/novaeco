# Documentation Style Guide

This guide ensures all Nova Ecosystem docs remain consistent and easy to read.

## Headings
- Use `#` for page titles, `##` for sections, `###` for subsections.
- Keep titles short and descriptive.

## Tone
- Write in clear, professional language.
- Use active voice.
- Avoid jargon unless defined in the Glossary.

## Linking
- Use relative links (e.g., `../requirements/functional.md`).
- Add “Back to Intro” and “Next Steps” links at the bottom of overview pages.
- Cross‑link related docs where relevant.

## ADRs
- File name: `adr-XXX-title.md`.
- Sections: Context, Decision, Consequences.
- Keep concise but complete.

## Code Examples
- Use fenced code blocks with language tags.
- Show minimal working examples.

## Navigation
- Add new pages to `sidebars.js`.
- Provide Previous/Next links for linear flow.
