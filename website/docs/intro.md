# Introduction

Welcome to the **Nova Ecosystem Documentation**!

This site is the single source of truth for contributors, developers, and stakeholders. It explains the architecture, requirements, use cases, APIs, developer workflows, and best practices that power the ecosystem.

---

## 📐 Architecture
Learn how the ecosystem is structured, including core services and documented **Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)**.  
➡️ See [Architecture Overview](./architecture/overview.md)

---

## 📋 Requirements
Understand the **functional, non‑functional, and sustainability requirements** that guide design and implementation.  
➡️ See [Requirements](./requirements/functional.md)

---

## 📊 Use Cases
Explore real‑world scenarios across four levels:
- **Level 1:** Onboarding & Control  
- **Level 2:** Transactional Efficiency  
- **Level 3:** Value Chain Coordination  
- **Level 4:** Systemic Transformation  
➡️ See [Use Cases](./usecases/level-1-onboarding.md)

---

## 🔌 API
Reference the **Gateway** and **Auth APIs**, with examples and testing strategies.  
➡️ See [API Overview](./api/overview.md)

---

## 👩‍💻 Developers
Step‑by‑step guides for setting up local environments, using the Nova CLI, and contributing via CI/CD workflows.  
➡️ See [Developer Setup](./developers/setup.md)

---

## 📚 Guides
Best practices, testing strategies, and sustainability guidelines for building within the ecosystem.  
➡️ See [Developer Guide](./guides/dev-guide.md)

---

## 📖 Glossary
A shared vocabulary of ecosystem terms, from **Enablers** and **Sectors** to **Workers** and **Products**.  
➡️ See [Glossary](./glossary.md)
