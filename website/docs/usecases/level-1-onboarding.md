# Level 1: Onboarding & Control (Foundational Integration)

**Focus:** Setup, IAM, API integration, data aggregation, and dashboard visibility.

---

## <a id="O1"></a> [O1] User Onboarding & Trust Profile

**Description**  
An individual or SME registers, verifies their identity, and establishes a "Trust Profile" holding credentials (e.g., Trade Register extract, ISO certs).

**Challenges**  
- Friction vs. Security balance  
- GDPR compliance  
- Cross-border verification  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Lack of trust prevents circular collaboration (e.g., *“Is this recycled plastic safe?”*).

**User Interaction**  
User visits `auth.novaeco.tech` → Registers via Email → Uploads proof of business → Admin verifies → “Verified” badge issued.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
Identity (Core), NovaPolicy (Verification Standards), NovaHub (Profile Display)

## <a id="O2"></a> [O2] API Key Generation

**Description**  
A developer generates secure API keys to integrate external systems (ERP, IoT) with the ecosystem’s data streams.

**Challenges**  
- Rate limiting  
- Secure secret storage  
- Preventing abuse  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Siloed data prevents systemic optimization. APIs allow external systems to “speak circular.”

**User Interaction**  
Developer logs into `novahub.network/developer` → Selects scopes (`read:waste`, `write:dpp`) → Generates Key → System provisions tenant.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
Identity (OAuth2), NovaInfra (API Gateway), NovaHub (Dev Portal)

---

## <a id="O3"></a> [O3] Sustainability Dashboard

**Description**  
Users view a personalized dashboard aggregating real-time impact metrics (CO₂, waste diverted) relevant to their role.

**Challenges**  
- Data normalization across sectors  
- Real-time latency  

**Sustainability Problem**  
“You can’t manage what you don’t measure.” Visibility drives behavioral change.

**User Interaction**  
Login to `app.novaeco.tech` → NovaBalance queries workers → Dashboard renders “CO₂ Saved” widget from NovaAir and “Water Saved” from NovaWater.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaBalance (Aggregator), Identity (Preferences), NovaAir/Water (Data Sources)

---

## <a id="O4"></a> [O4] Cross-Sector Data Aggregation

**Description**  
The system ingests Digital Product Passport (DPP) and LCA data from multiple sectors to create a holistic view of a product’s history.

**Challenges**  
- Semantic interoperability (mapping data standards)  
- Handling missing data  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Fragmentation. A shirt’s impact includes NovaAgro (cotton) and NovaChem (dye) data.

**User Interaction**  
User searches “Recycled Beam” → System queries `novamaterial-worker-dpp-sync` → Merges with `novabalance-worker-impact-calculator` → Displays total footprint.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaMaterial, NovaBalance, NovaHub (Search), NovaSapien (Normalization)

---

## <a id="O5"></a> [O5] Circular Marketplace Discovery

**Description**  
Users discover and connect to sector-specific apps (e.g., NovaTronix repair shops) via a central “App Store.”

**Challenges**  
- Curation quality  
- Seamless SSO handoff  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Circular solutions exist but are invisible. Centralized discovery drives adoption.

**User Interaction**  
User browses `novaeco.tech/marketplace` → Clicks “Electronics Repair” → Redirects to `novatronix.tech` with Auth Token.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaTrade (Directory), Identity (SSO), NovaTronix (Target)

---

## <a id="O6"></a> [O6] Community Governance

**Description**  
Contributors propose and vote on ecosystem changes (e.g., “Add new bioplastic standard”) via NovaPolicy.

**Challenges**  
- Voter apathy  
- “Whale” voting dominance  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Top-down mandates fail. Bottom-up governance ensures the system meets actual needs.

**User Interaction**  
User goes to NovaPolicy → Views proposal → Stakes reputation tokens to vote “Yes” → Smart contract records vote.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaPolicy (Logic), Identity (Reputation Score), NovaHub (Forum)

---

## <a id="O7"></a> [O7] Multi-Tenant Access Management

**Description**  
Large organizations manage teams, roles, and granular permissions across the ecosystem.

**Challenges**  
- Mapping complex corporate hierarchies  
- Strict data isolation  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Corporate silos. The ESG team needs to see what Procurement is buying to align goals.

**User Interaction**  
Admin creates “Procurement Team” in Identity → Assigns read/write to NovaTrade and read-only to NovaBalance.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
Identity (RBAC), NovaHub (Team View)

---

## <a id="O8"></a> [O8] Ecosystem-Wide LCA Calculation

**Description**  
Automated background process recalculates Life Cycle Assessments (LCA) as new data (e.g., grid mix) enters the system.

**Challenges**  
- Computational load  
- Versioning of LCA datasets  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Static LCAs are obsolete. Dynamic LCAs provide a real-time truth.

**User Interaction**  
(System) NovaEnergy updates grid intensity → `novabalance-worker-impact-calculator` triggers → Updates all relevant Product Passports.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaBalance (Calc), NovaEnergy (Data), NovaMaterial (Object)

---

## <a id="O9"></a> [O9] Urban Mining Coordination

**Description**  
A project management tool orchestrating complex urban mining logistics (demolition → sorting → reuse).

**Challenges**  
- Syncing physical logistics with digital planning  
- Uncertain material yields  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Cities are “mines,” but lack of coordination leads to landfilling.

**User Interaction**  
City Planner starts “Project Munich North” in NovaHub → Imports NovaBuild demolition data → NovaSapien predicts yield → NovaWaste reserves capacity.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaHub (Orchestration), NovaBuild, NovaWaste, NovaSapien

---

## <a id="O10"></a> [O10] Central Audit & Compliance Dashboard

**Description**  
Regulators/Auditors view compliance status across all sectors, flagging violations (e.g., “Missing Child Labor Cert”).

**Challenges**  
- Presenting complex legal data simply  
- Data immutability  

**Sustainability Problem**  
Greenwashing. Verified, immutable compliance data builds trust.

**User Interaction**  
Auditor logs in → Filters “Pending Reviews” → Drills into NovaTextile chain → Verifies NovaEquity proof → Approves.

**Ecosystem Usage**  
NovaPolicy (Rules), NovaEquity (Social), NovaBalance (Env)
