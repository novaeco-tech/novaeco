**Focus:** Direct P2P/B2C interactions, Simple Logging, and Alerts.
**Goal:** Validating that single-step actions work reliably across specific sectors.

## [E1] The Waste Match

**Description**
A bakery lists "Coffee Grounds" on `NovaTrade`. A mushroom farm buys them instantly. This simple transaction diverts organic waste from landfill and provides cheap local feedstock.

**Challenges**
- Logistics for small volumes (micro-hauling).
- Ensuring freshness/quality of the waste stream.

**Sustainability Problem**
Valuable organic nutrients are often landfilled because the transaction cost to find a buyer is too high.

**User Interaction**
Bakery creates listing on `NovaTrade` → Mushroom Farm accepts offer → `NovaRecycle` schedules pickup → `NovaAgro` logs the nutrient input.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaTrade` (Marketplace), `NovaRecycle` (Logistics Trigger), `NovaAgro` (End User)

## [E2] Print Job Request

**Description**
A user uploads a spare part STL file to `NovaMake`. The `Slicer Check` worker automatically verifies printability before a job is accepted.

**Challenges**
- Validating file integrity and physical constraints.
- Matching material properties to printer capabilities.

**Sustainability Problem**
Shipping spare parts globally creates unnecessary emissions. Local, on-demand production extends product life with minimal carbon footprint.

**User Interaction**
User uploads STL to `NovaMake` → `SlicerCheck` worker analyzes geometry → `NovaMind` estimates print time → Job is queued for local FabLab.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaMake` (Manufacturing Interface), `SlicerCheck` (Validation Worker), `NovaMind` (Optimization)

## [E3] Water Quality Alert

**Description**
`NovaWater` detects a pH drop in a river sensor and triggers an immediate SMS alert to the city environment bureau.

**Challenges**
- Real-time data processing latency.
- Filtering false positives from sensor noise.

**Sustainability Problem**
Delayed responses to pollution events cause irreversible ecosystem damage. Real-time alerts enable rapid containment.

**User Interaction**
Sensor sends telemetry to `NovaInfra` → `NovaWater` logic detects threshold breach → `NovaAdmin` pushes notification to City Dashboard.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaWater` (Domain Logic), `NovaInfra` (Telemetry), `NovaAdmin` (Notification)

## [E4] Phone Repair Log

**Description**
A technician logs a battery swap in `NovaTronix`, automatically updating the phone's `NovaMaterial` Digital Product Passport (DPP) to reflect the new component.

**Challenges**
- Linking physical repairs to digital records.
- Verifying the quality of the replacement part.

**Sustainability Problem**
Without repair history, devices lose resale value and are discarded prematurely. Validated repair logs increase trust in second-hand electronics.

**User Interaction**
Technician scans phone IMEI in `NovaTronix` → Selects "Battery Replacement" → `NovaMaterial` appends event to DPP → `NovaSkills` verifies technician ID.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaTronix` (Repair Interface), `NovaMaterial` (DPP Storage), `NovaSkills` (Auth)

## [E5] Carbon Credit Buy

**Description**
An office buys 10 "Nature Credits" via `NovaTrade` to offset a flight. The funds are routed to a verified `NovaNature` reforestation project.

**Challenges**
- Preventing double-counting of credits.
- Ensuring funds actually reach the project on the ground.

**Sustainability Problem**
Carbon markets often lack transparency. Direct, traceable purchases build trust and ensure capital flows to effective nature-based solutions.

**User Interaction**
Office Admin selects project in `NovaTrade` → Pays via `NovaFin` → `NovaNature` retires the credits → Certificate is issued.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaTrade` (Marketplace), `NovaFin` (Settlement), `NovaNature` (Asset Origin)

## [E6] The Crop Scan

**Description**
`DurasAGV` scans a corn field. `NovaMind` processes the imagery to identify nitrogen deficiency, enabling precise fertilizer application.

**Challenges**
- Processing large image datasets on the edge or cloud.
- Accurate computer vision models for specific crop diseases.

**Sustainability Problem**
Over-fertilization causes runoff and pollution. Precision agriculture reduces chemical use while maintaining yields.

**User Interaction**
Robot uploads image batch → `NovaMind` inference engine classifies health → `NovaAgro` generates a "Treatment Map" for the farmer.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`DurasAGV` (Data Source), `NovaAgro` (Farm Management), `NovaMind` (AI Inference)

## [E7] Smart Bin Pickup

**Description**
A glass recycling bin reports "90% Full" to `NovaRecycle`. A pickup request is automatically generated and optimized.

**Challenges**
- Sensor battery life and connectivity.
- Optimizing routes dynamically to save fuel.

**Sustainability Problem**
Static collection schedules result in empty bins being collected (wasting fuel) or full bins overflowing (littering). Demand-responsive collection solves this.

**User Interaction**
Bin sensor triggers threshold in `NovaRecycle` → `NovaLogistics` adds stop to current route → Driver receives update.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaRecycle` (Asset Management), `NovaLogistics` (Route Optimization)

## [E8] Tutor Booking

**Description**
A student books a "Circular Design" expert on `NovaSkills` for a 1-hour session. Payment is held in escrow until the session is complete.

**Challenges**
- Verifying expertise.
- Managing scheduling and time zones.

**Sustainability Problem**
The transition to a circular economy requires a massive upskilling of the workforce. Peer-to-peer knowledge transfer accelerates this learning curve.

**User Interaction**
Student searches `NovaSkills` → Books slot → `NovaFin` locks funds → Session occurs → Funds released to Tutor.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaSkills` (Marketplace), `NovaFin` (Escrow/Payment)

---

## [E9] Return Initiation

**Description**
A consumer clicks "Return" on a rented jacket via the `RetailLoop` plugin. A return label is generated, and the item's status changes to "In Transit".

**Challenges**
- Seamless integration with carrier APIs.
- Updating inventory status across systems.

**Sustainability Problem**
Complexity in returns discourages circular behaviors like rental and resale. Frictionless returns are key to "Product-as-a-Service" adoption.

**User Interaction**
User clicks return in order history → `RetailLoop` calls `NovaLogistics` API → Label generated → `NovaRetail` updates asset status.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`RetailLoop` (Plugin), `NovaRetail` (Asset State), `NovaLogistics` (Shipping)

---

## [E10] Compliance Check

**Description**
`NovaPolicy` checks a toy's Bill of Materials (BOM) against the EU "Substances of Concern" list to ensure regulatory compliance before import.

**Challenges**
- Keeping regulatory databases up to date.
- Parsing complex chemical hierarchies in BOMs.

**Sustainability Problem**
Hazardous chemicals in products prevent safe recycling. Automated screening ensures only safe, compliant materials enter the loop.

**User Interaction**
Importer submits BOM to `NovaPolicy` → System queries `NovaChem` database → Returns "Pass/Fail" report → `NovaMaterial` flags the passport.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaPolicy` (Rules Engine), `NovaMaterial` (Product Data), `NovaChem` (Substance Data)

---

## [E11] Solar Energy Log

**Description**
A home inverter pushes daily kWh production to `NovaEnergy`. This data is verified and logged in `NovaBalance` for green certification.

**Challenges**
- Interoperability with diverse inverter protocols.
- Preventing data tampering.

**Sustainability Problem**
Distributed renewable energy needs to be accounted for to displace fossil fuels accurately. Verified generation data is the currency of the energy transition.

**User Interaction**
Inverter API pushes data → `NovaEnergy` validates timestamp/signature → `NovaBalance` records "Green Energy Produced" metric.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaEnergy` (Grid Integration), `NovaBalance` (Audit Ledger)

---

## [E12] Packaging Deposit

**Description**
A user scans a reusable cup at a `NovaPack` kiosk. The deposit paid at purchase is instantly refunded to their `NovaFin` wallet.

**Challenges**
- Identifying unique items (serialization).
- Preventing deposit fraud (double refunds).

**Sustainability Problem**
Single-use packaging is a major waste stream. Deposit Return Schemes (DRS) incentivize return, but must be convenient and instant to work.

**User Interaction**
User scans cup QR at kiosk → Kiosk validates ID with `NovaPack` → `NovaFin` triggers refund transaction → User notification received.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaPack` (Item Registry), `NovaFin` (Payment), `NovaAdmin` (User Dashboard)
