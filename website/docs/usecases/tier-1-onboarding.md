## [O1] The Citizen Passport

**Description**
A resident registers via the central **Identity Provider (Keycloak)** to access city recycling services and green infrastructure. Their Trust Profile is established and synched to the ecosystem.

**Challenges**
- Balancing ease of access with security (preventing bot accounts).
- Ensuring data privacy (GDPR) for citizen data.

**Sustainability Problem**
Without a digital identity, citizens cannot participate in incentive schemes (e.g., getting credits for recycling) or access shared resources securely.

**User Interaction**
User visits `admin.novaeco.tech` → Redirects to `id.novaeco.tech` (Keycloak) → Registers with email → `Core/Auth` issues a standard "Citizen" Trust Profile → User lands on Mission Control Dashboard.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`Core/Identity` (Keycloak), `Core/Auth` (Trust Profile), `NovaAdmin` (Dashboard)

## [O2] The Corporate KYC

**Description**
A textile factory uploads ISO 14001 or other sustainability certificates to `NovaSkills` to unlock B2B trading capabilities.

**Challenges**
- Verifying the authenticity of uploaded documents.
- Handling expiration and renewal of certificates automatically.

**Sustainability Problem**
"Greenwashing" is rampant. Trusted, verified actors are needed to build a legitimate circular supply chain.

**User Interaction**
Factory Admin logs into `NovaSkills` → Uploads PDF of ISO 14001 cert → `NovaPolicy` validates the issuer → `NovaTrade` updates the company's profile to "Verified Supplier".

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaSkills` (Credential Store), `NovaPolicy` (Verification Logic), `NovaTrade` (Marketplace Permissions)

## [O3] Sensor Enrollment

**Description**
A technician scans a QR code on a new air quality monitor to register it in `NovaInfra`, establishing its "Physical Twin" in the digital system.

**Challenges**
- Secure device provisioning (preventing spoofed data).
- Scalability when enrolling thousands of sensors.

**Sustainability Problem**
We cannot manage what we cannot measure. Accurate, tamper-proof environmental data is the foundation of the circular economy.

**User Interaction**
Technician scans QR code via mobile app → `NovaInfra` registers device ID → `NovaAir` assigns it to a location → `IoTIngest` worker begins listening for telemetry.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaInfra` (Device Registry), `NovaAir` (Sector Context), `IoTIngest` (Data Pipeline)

---

## [O4] Material Declaration

**Description**
A chemical supplier defines a new "Bio-Solvent" SKU in `NovaMaterial`, populating its safety data and chemical composition to solve the "black box" problem.

**Challenges**
- Intellectual Property (IP) protection vs. Transparency.
- Standardizing chemical data formats (JSON-LD).

**Sustainability Problem**
Recyclers cannot recover materials if they don't know the chemical ingredients. Transparency is essential for safe recycling.

**User Interaction**
Supplier logs into `NovaMaterial` → Enters CAS numbers and hazards → `NovaPolicy` checks against restricted substance lists → Product Passport is created.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaMaterial` (DPP Engine), `NovaChem` (Chemical Domain Logic), `NovaPolicy` (Compliance Check)

---

## [O5] The Innovation Profile

**Description**
A startup creates a "Solver Profile" in `NovaLab` to find funding for a new bioplastic, showcasing their technology readiness level (TRL) and impact potential.

**Challenges**
- Matching solutions to the right problems (taxonomy).
- Vetting early-stage startups.

**Sustainability Problem**
Capital often flows to the wrong places. A structured profile helps connect genuine problem solvers with impact investors.

**User Interaction**
Founder fills out "Innovation Wizard" in `NovaLab` → Selects "Bioplastics" category → System suggests relevant grants → Profile becomes visible to investors.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaLab` (Innovation Engine), `NovaAdmin` (Discovery Interface)

---

## [O6] Wallet Creation

**Description**
A farm instantiates a `NovaTrade` wallet to receive payments for ecosystem services like carbon sequestration or water retention.

**Challenges**
- Financial inclusion for unbanked or rural stakeholders.
- Regulatory compliance (KYC/AML) for financial accounts.

**Sustainability Problem**
Farmers are often the stewards of the land but are rarely paid for the "ecosystem services" (clean air, soil health) they provide.

**User Interaction**
Farmer logs into `NovaTrade` → Clicks "Create Wallet" → `NovaFin` provisions a ledger account → Wallet address is linked to their `NovaAgro` farm profile.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaTrade` (Interface), `NovaFin` (Ledger/Banking), `NovaAgro` (Business Context)

---

## [O7] Printer Capability

**Description**
A FabLab registers a 3D printer's specifications (e.g., "Prusa i3, PLA/PETG compatible") in `NovaMake` to accept local manufacturing jobs.

**Challenges**
- Standardizing machine capabilities data.
- Verifying machine calibration/quality.

**Sustainability Problem**
Distributed manufacturing reduces shipping emissions, but only if we know *where* the capacity exists locally.

**User Interaction**
FabLab manager adds machine in `NovaMake` → Selects "PLA" and "PETG" materials → `NovaInfra` records the location → Machine appears on the "Local Capacity Map".

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaMake` (Manufacturing Matcher), `NovaInfra` (Physical Asset Registry)

---

## [O8] Retailer Plugin

**Description**
An e-commerce shop installs the `RetailLoop` plugin to enable a "One-Click Resale" button for their customers, closing the loop on sold items.

**Challenges**
- Integration with diverse e-commerce platforms (Shopify, WooCommerce).
- Reverse logistics cost estimation.

**Sustainability Problem**
Take-back schemes are often too difficult for users. Frictionless, one-click resale embedded in the store increases participation.

**User Interaction**
Shop owner installs plugin → Authenticates with `NovaRetail` → Customers now see "Sell this back" on their order history page.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`RetailLoop` (Plugin Product), `NovaRetail` (Resale Logic)

---

## [O9] Vehicle Registration

**Description**
A logistics firm adds an electric van to `NovaLogistics` to become eligible for "Green Routing" jobs within the ecosystem.

**Challenges**
- Verifying vehicle emission class.
- Real-time availability tracking.

**Sustainability Problem**
Decarbonizing transport requires prioritizing zero-emission vehicles for ecosystem logistics.

**User Interaction**
Fleet manager uploads vehicle registration to `NovaLogistics` → `NovaInfra` validates EV status → Vehicle is tagged "Zero-Emission" for route optimization.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaLogistics` (Fleet Management), `NovaInfra` (Asset Registry)

---

## [O10] Developer Access

**Description**
A climate-tech developer generates an API Key in the `Gateway` to build a custom water monitoring app using NovaEco data.

**Challenges**
- API rate limiting and quota management.
- Preventing data scraping abuse.

**Sustainability Problem**
Open Data democratizes innovation. Allowing third-party devs to build on the platform accelerates solution deployment.

**User Interaction**
Developer logs into `admin.novaeco.tech` → navigates to Developer Portal → Requests `read:water` scope → `Core/Gateway` issues a secure API Key.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`Core/Gateway` (API Management), `NovaAdmin` (Developer Dashboard)

---

## [O11] Worker Certification

**Description**
A repair technician uploads their "Electronics Repair L2" certificate to `NovaSkills` to validate their right to perform official repairs.

**Challenges**
- Verifying diverse global certification standards.
- Preventing forged documents.

**Sustainability Problem**
The "Right to Repair" needs a skilled workforce. Verifying skills ensures repairs are safe and effective, extending product life.

**User Interaction**
Technician uploads cert to `NovaSkills` → Admin or AI verifies issuer → `NovaTronix` grants permission to log "Official Repairs" on devices.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaSkills` (Credentialing), `NovaTronix` (Repair Sector)

---

## [O12] Biodiversity Plot

**Description**
A forester defines a GPS boundary for a new reforestation project in `NovaNature`, establishing the "Natural Asset" that will be monitored.

**Challenges**
- Accurate geospatial mapping.
- Defining land ownership/rights.

**Sustainability Problem**
To pay for nature restoration, we must clearly define *where* it is happening and measure the baseline.

**User Interaction**
Forester draws polygon on map in `NovaNature` app → System calculates area → `NovaInfra` registers the geospatial asset → Baseline monitoring begins.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaNature` (Biodiversity Logic), `NovaInfra` (Geospatial Registry)
