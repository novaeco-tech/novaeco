## [M1] The Circular Loop

**Description**
`NovaLab` matches a demolition site (`NovaBuild`) with a road paver (`NovaMake`) for concrete reuse. This orchestrates a direct material exchange between two industrial sectors.

**Challenges**
- Timing the demolition with the road paving schedule.
- Verifying the quality/grade of the crushed concrete.

**Sustainability Problem**
Construction and demolition waste is one of the largest waste streams globally. Diverting concrete from landfills for reuse significantly reduces the need for virgin aggregate.

**User Interaction**
`NovaLab` identifies the match → `NovaBuild` confirms demolition date and material volume → `NovaMake` accepts the material for a project → `NovaTrade` generates the contract.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaLab` (Orchestration), `NovaBuild` (Source), `NovaMake` (Destination).

## [M2] Fair Wage Audit

**Description**
`NovaFin` detects a payment to a coffee co-op. `NovaEquity` automatically triggers a survey to workers to verify fair compensation.

**Challenges**
- Reaching workers in remote areas with limited connectivity.
- Ensuring survey anonymity to prevent retaliation.

**Sustainability Problem**
Supply chains often obscure labor practices. Verifiable, direct-to-worker audits ensure that the "green transition" is also a socially fair one.

**User Interaction**
Payment transaction logged in `NovaFin` → `NovaEquity` sends SMS survey to registered workers → Responses are aggregated and an "Equity Score" is updated on the Co-op's profile.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaFin` (Trigger), `NovaEquity` (Audit Logic), `NovaAgro` (Worker Registry).

## [M3] Grid Balancing

**Description**
`NovaEnergy` detects a grid spike and commands `NovaLogistics` EV chargers to pause charging. This demand response helps stabilize the renewable energy grid.

**Challenges**
- Latency requirements (response must be < 1 second).
- Ensuring fleet readiness (trucks must still be charged by morning).

**Sustainability Problem**
Renewable energy is intermittent. Demand response systems allow the grid to handle fluctuations without turning on fossil-fuel peaker plants.

**User Interaction**
Grid operator signals peak load → `NovaEnergy` broadcasts "Pause" command → `NovaLogistics` chargers stop drawing power → `NovaFin` credits the fleet for the service.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaEnergy` (Grid Logic), `NovaLogistics` (Asset Control), `NovaInfra` (Connectivity).

## [M4] LCA Calculation

**Description**
A shoe designer changes a material in their CAD software. The `LCACalc` worker recalculates the carbon footprint instantly, providing real-time feedback.

**Challenges**
- Accessing accurate, localized environmental impact factors.
- Computational speed for complex multi-part assemblies.

**Sustainability Problem**
Most environmental impact decisions are locked in during the design phase. Real-time feedback empowers designers to make lower-carbon choices.

**User Interaction**
Designer updates Bill of Materials (BOM) in `NovaMake` → `LCACalc` processes new material data → `NovaBalance` returns updated CO2e score to the UI.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaMaterial` (Data Source), `LCACalc` (Worker), `NovaBalance` (Audit).

---

## [M5] Reverse Logistics

**Description**
`NovaRetail` batches 50 individual returns. `NovaLogistics` optimizes a single truck route to collect them all efficiently.

**Challenges**
- Dynamic routing with unpredictable traffic.
- Coordinating pickup windows with 50 different users.

**Sustainability Problem**
Individual return shipments (one van per package) generate massive Scope 3 emissions. Consolidated "milk runs" significantly reduce transport carbon.

**User Interaction**
`NovaRetail` flags items as "Ready for Pickup" → `NovaLogistics` algorithm builds optimal route → Driver app receives the manifest.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaRetail` (Demand Source), `NovaLogistics` (Optimization), `NovaMind` (Routing AI).

## [M6] Biodiversity Audit

**Description**
The `Bioacoustics` worker analyzes audio streams from `NovaNature` sensors. It verifies the return of a specific bird species to release a credit payout.

**Challenges**
- Distinguishing bird calls from background noise (wind, machinery).
- Processing large audio files efficiently.

**Sustainability Problem**
Paying for "nature restoration" requires proof of outcome. Bioacoustics provides an objective, scalable way to measure biodiversity health.

**User Interaction**
Field sensor uploads .wav file → `Bioacoustics` worker identifies "Target Species" → `NovaNature` confirms success criteria → `NovaTrade` unlocks escrowed funds.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaNature` (Domain Context), `Bioacoustics` (AI Worker), `NovaTrade` (Financial Execution).

## [M7] Chemical Leasing

**Description**
A car plant pays for "Degreasing Service" via `NovaChem` instead of buying solvents by the liter. The supplier retains ownership and responsibility for the chemical.

**Challenges**
- Monitoring chemical efficacy and quality in real-time.
- Defining the "service unit" (e.g., per cleaned part).

**Sustainability Problem**
Selling chemicals by volume incentivizes waste. "Chemical Leasing" aligns incentives: the supplier makes more profit by using *less* chemical to do the same job.

**User Interaction**
IoT sensors measure cleaning performance → `NovaChem` tracks usage → `NovaFin` bills the car plant based on "Parts Cleaned" → `NovaRecycle` manages solvent recovery.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaChem` (Service Logic), `NovaFin` (Billing), `NovaRecycle` (Recovery).

---

## [M8] Urban Mining Map

**Description**
`UrbanMiner` aggregates data from `NovaRecycle` (bin contents) and `NovaBuild` (demolition permits) to map the city's stocks of copper and steel.

**Challenges**
- Harmonizing data from disparate sources.
- Predicting material quality/grade inside standing buildings.

**Sustainability Problem**
Cities contain vast reserves of valuable materials ("Urban Mines"). Mapping them allows us to recover these resources instead of mining virgin ore.

**User Interaction**
City Planner opens `UrbanMiner` dashboard → Selects "Copper" layer → Map visualizes hotspots of recoverable material → Data feeds into `NovaTrade` for future sourcing.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`UrbanMiner` (Product), `NovaRecycle` (Data Source), `NovaBuild` (Data Source).

## [M9] Textile Sorting

**Description**
A robot uses `NovaMind` computer vision to identify and sort clothing items by fiber type (Cotton, Poly, Blend) in a `NovaTextile` facility.

**Challenges**
- Identifying fiber blends without physical labels.
- High-speed processing requirements.

**Sustainability Problem**
Mixed-fiber textiles are notoriously difficult to recycle. Automated, accurate sorting is the bottleneck preventing textile-to-textile recycling at scale.

**User Interaction**
Conveyor belt moves garment → Camera captures image → `NovaMind` classifies "100% Cotton" → `NovaInfra` air jet diverts item to correct bin.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaTextile` (Sector Logic), `NovaMind` (Vision AI), `NovaInfra` (Hardware Control).

---

## [M10] Green Concrete

**Description**
`NovaBuild` generates a product passport for a structural beam using `NovaMaterial`, specifically logging the carbon captured during its curing process.

**Challenges**
- Verifying the carbon capture methodology.
- Ensuring data persists for the building's 50+ year lifespan.

**Sustainability Problem**
Construction materials contain high "embodied carbon." Tracking and verifying low-carbon or carbon-negative materials drives market demand for them.

**User Interaction**
Manufacturer scans beam → Logs production data in `NovaMaterial` → `NovaBalance` verifies CO2 calculation → Passport is linked to the building model in `NovaBuild`.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaBuild` (Context), `NovaMaterial` (Passport), `NovaBalance` (Audit).

---

## [M11] Swarm Farming

**Description**
A fleet of `DurasAGV` units coordinates to harvest a field. They communicate via `NovaInfra` to optimize paths and avoid soil compaction.

**Challenges**
- Peer-to-peer communication in areas with poor cellular coverage.
- Collision avoidance and safety.

**Sustainability Problem**
Heavy tractors compact soil, killing its biology. Swarms of small, light robots preserve soil health while performing the same work.

**User Interaction**
Farmer defines field boundary in `NovaAgro` → Swarm is deployed → Robots divide tasks autonomously → Harvest data is uploaded to `NovaAgro`.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`DurasAGV` (Product), `NovaInfra` (Comms), `NovaAgro` (Command).

## [M12] Air Credit Minting

**Description**
The `AirQuality` worker verifies a sustained drop in pollution levels in a specific zone. `NovaTrade` mints a "Clean Air Credit" for the city.

**Challenges**
- Establishing a credible baseline.
- Proving causality (did the intervention cause the drop?).

**Sustainability Problem**
Clean air is a public good often undervalued by markets. Creating financial instruments ("Credits") for air quality improvements incentivizes pollution reduction.

**User Interaction**
Sensors stream data to `NovaAir` → `AirQuality` worker computes 30-day average → If target met, `NovaTrade` mints token → City can sell or retire the credit.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaAir` (Data), `AirQuality` (Worker), `NovaTrade` (Minting).
