## [C1] Fiber-to-Fiber

**Description**
Old shirts are collected via the `RetailLoop` plugin, sorted by `NovaMind` AI vision, chemically recycled into monomers by `NovaChem`, and spun into new yarn by `NovaTextile`.

**Challenges**
- Separating mixed-fiber blends (e.g., cotton-polyester) at scale.
- Managing the energy intensity of chemical recycling processes.

**Sustainability Problem**
The fashion industry creates massive waste. True circularity requires "closed loops" where materials are infinitely recycled without degrading quality (downcycling), ending the reliance on virgin fibers.


**User Interaction**
Consumer initiates return → `NovaLogistics` delivers to facility → `NovaMind` sorter scans fiber content → `NovaChem` processes feedstock → `NovaTextile` produces virgin-quality yarn.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`NovaRetail` (Collection), `NovaLogistics` (Transport), `NovaChem` (Recycling), `NovaTextile` (Production).

**Challenges**
- Integrating legacy municipal systems with modern IoT.
- Data governance and privacy for city-wide aggregation.

**Sustainability Problem**
Cities consume the vast majority of global resources. Data-driven governance allows cities to function as metabolisms, optimizing flows to reach Net Zero.


**User Interaction**
Mayor views `NovaAdmin` dashboard → Identifies "High Waste" district → Adjusts collection policy in `NovaRecycle` → Simulates impact on energy recovery.

**Ecosystem Usage**
`UrbanMiner` (Product), `NovaWater` (Data), `NovaEnergy` (Data), `NovaRecycle` (Data), `NovaAdmin` (Visualization).
